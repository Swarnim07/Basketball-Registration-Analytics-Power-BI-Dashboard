## 🧩 Problem Statement

A youth basketball academy has accumulated several years of player, family, and program registration data. However, they are unable to extract meaningful insights due to the following challenges:

- ❌ No visibility into key revenue drivers  
- ❌ Difficulty identifying top-performing programs and locations  
- ❌ Inability to analyze family (customer) spending patterns  
- ❌ No way to monitor year-over-year registrations or seasonal patterns  
- ❌ Lack of insights into player demographics (age groups, states, cities)  
- ❌ No centralized dashboard to support data-driven decision making  

The organization needs a **clean, interactive dashboard** that helps them analyze:

- ✔ Revenue  
- ✔ Collections  
- ✔ Program Performance  
- ✔ Family / Customer Value  
- ✔ Player Demographics  
- ✔ Registration Trends
