🏀 Basketball Registration Analytics – Power BI Dashboard
🧩 Problem Statement

A youth basketball academy has accumulated several years of player, family, and program registration data.
However, they are unable to extract meaningful insights due to the following challenges:

❌ No visibility into key revenue drivers

❌ Difficulty identifying top-performing programs and locations

❌ Inability to analyze family (customer) spending patterns

❌ No way to monitor year-over-year registrations or seasonal trends

❌ Lack of insights into player demographics (age groups, geographic distribution)

❌ No centralized dashboard to support strategic decisions

The organization wants a clean, interactive dashboard that allows them to analyze:

✔ Revenue
✔ Collections
✔ Program Performance
✔ Family/Customer Value
✔ Player Demographics
✔ Registration Trends

✅ Solution

To address these challenges, I developed a 6-page interactive Power BI dashboard that provides complete visibility across registrations, revenue, programs, families, and demographics.

📊 Key Insights
🏀 1. Registrations Have Declined YoY

CY registrations are lower than LY

YoY Growth is around –38%

Major drop after 2023–2024 peak

💵 2. Revenue Is Concentrated in a Few Programs

Top programs bring majority of revenue

Long tail of programs with low enrollments

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 3. A Small Number of Families Drive Large Revenue

Top 10 families contribute a significant portion

High repeat registration behavior → strong loyalty

🎯 4. Age Groups 9–11 & 12–14 Dominate

These age groups represent the highest participation

Good segment to target for marketing

🌎 5. State Distribution Dominated by CT

Majority of players are from Connecticut

Other states contribute minimally (pie size issue justified due to space constraints)

📅 6. Seasons Show Clear Participation Patterns

Fall and Spring show highest enrollments

Winter programs lower but stable

Summer camps moderately consistent
