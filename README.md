🧩 Problem Statement

A youth basketball academy has accumulated several years of player, family, and program registration data. However, they are unable to extract meaningful insights due to the following challenges:

❌ No visibility into key revenue drivers

❌ Difficulty identifying top-performing programs and locations

❌ Inability to analyze family (customer) spending patterns

❌ No way to monitor year-over-year registrations or seasonal trends

❌ Lack of insights into player demographics (age groups, geographic distribution)

❌ No centralized dashboard to support strategic decisions

The organization needs a clean, interactive dashboard that helps them analyze:

✔ Revenue

✔ Collections

✔ Program Performance

✔ Family/Customer Value

✔ Player Demographics

✔ Registration Trends

✅ Solution

To address these challenges, I developed a 6-page interactive Power BI dashboard that provides complete visibility across registrations, revenue, programs, families, and demographics.
