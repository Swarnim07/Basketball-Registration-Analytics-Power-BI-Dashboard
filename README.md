🧩 Problem Statement

A youth basketball academy is looking to analyze player, family, and program registration data collected over several years. However, they are facing several challenges:

Difficulty identifying key revenue drivers

Limited visibility into top-performing vs underperforming programs

No clear insights into family (customer) spending patterns

Inability to monitor year-over-year registrations or seasonal patterns

No depth in understanding player demographics (age groups, states, cities)

No centralized dashboard to support data-driven decision making

To overcome these challenges, the organization needs an interactive and unified Power BI dashboard that helps them analyze:

Revenue

Collections

Program Performance

Family / Customer Value

Player Demographics

Registration Trends
